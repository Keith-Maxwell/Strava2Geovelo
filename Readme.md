# Strava2Geovelo

This script allows to transfer your activities from Strava to Geovelo.

## Why

The geovelo website allows the upload of GPX files (geolocation info of your activities), but only one by one. You cannot upload multiple GPX files at once.
So I made this script that automatically does it one by one for all the activities in your Strava data export.

## How to use
